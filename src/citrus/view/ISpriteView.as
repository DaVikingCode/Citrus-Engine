	 * The ISpriteView interface provides a common interface between a CitrusObject and the SpriteView view manager.
	 * All objects that need to have graphical representations on screen need to implement this, if your
	 * objects are in a state that uses the CitrusView as its view (most common). Often, especially
	 * when working with Box2D, game object units will be different than than view object units.
	 * In Box2D, units are in meters, but graphics are rendered in pixels.
	 * Citrus Engine does not put a requirement on whether the game logic or the view manager should
	 * perform the conversion. 
	 * If you desire the game logic to perform the unit conversion, the values should be multiplied by
	 * [commonly] 30 before being returned in order to convert the meter values to pixel values.

		 * This is where you specify what your graphical representation of your CitrusObject will be.

		 * <p>You can specify your <code>view</code> value in multiple ways:</p>
		 * 
		 * <p>If you want your graphic to be a SWF, PNG, or JPG that
		 * is loaded at runtime, then assign <code>view</code> a String URL relative to your game's SWF, just like you would
		 * if you were loading any file in Flash. (graphic = "graphics/Hero.swf")</p>
		 * 
		 * <p>If your graphic is embedded into the SWF, you can assign the <code>view</code> property in two ways: Either by package string
		 * notation (view = "com.myGame.MyHero"), or by using a direct class reference (graphic = MyHero). The first method, String notation, is useful
		 * when you are using a level editor such as the Flash IDE or GLEED2D because all data must come through in String form. However, if you
		 * are hardcoding your graphic class, you can simply pass a direct reference to the class.
		 * Whichever way you specify your class, your class must be (on some level) a <code>DisplayObject</code>.</p>
		 * 
		 * <p>You can specify your <code>view</code> as an instance of a display object depending of your view renderer.</p>
		 * 
		 * <p>If you are using a level editor and using the ObjectMaker to batch-create your
		 * CitrusObjects, you will need to specify the entire classpath in string form and let the factory turn your string
		 * into an actual class. Also, the class definition (MyHeroGraphic, for example) will need to be compiled into your code
		 * somewhere, otherwise the game will not be able to get the class definition from a String.</p>
		 * 
		 * <p>If your graphic is an external file such as a PNG, JPG, or SWF, you can provide the path to the file (either an absolute path,
		 * or a relative path from your HTML file or SWF). The SpriteView will detect that it is an external file and
		 * load the file using the LoadManager class.</p>
