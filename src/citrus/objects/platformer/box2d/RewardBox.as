	/**
	 * The RewardBox is a special type of platform that you can "bump" to make a reward come out. It is meant to be similar
	 * to those "question blocks" or "mystery blocks" in mario.
	 * 
	 * <ul>Params: 
	 * <li>rewardClass : it specifies what kind of reward to have the box create. The reward class object
	 * that is generated must extend the "Reward" class.</li>
	 * <li>"collision normal" angle : it specifies the angle that you must come at it in order for it to generate a reward. The default is 90,
	 * which is "from below", as long as the box is not rotated.</li></ul>
	 * 
	 * <p>This means that you must also create a class that extends <code>Reward</code> for every reward type that you want in your game.
	 * If you were making a mario clone, you would make a FireFlowerReward. This is where you would specify the reward's graphics,
	 * its initial impulse out of the box, and any custom code such as unique movement or a death timer.</p>
	 * 
	 * <ul>Animations:
	 * <li>Your Reward box should have a "normal" and "used" animation state. Once the box's reward has been obtained, it cannot be used again.</li></ul>
	 * 
	 * <ul>Events:
	 * <li>onUse : gets dispatched when the reward box gets bumped. It passes a reference of itself.</li>
	 * <li>onRewardCollect : gets dispatched when the reward is collected. This is where you would
	 * write the code to grant your player the reward (such as a greater jump height, more points, or another life).</li></ul>
	 * 
	 * <ul>Other: 
	 * <li>If you don't want the reward box to generate a reward, (or you want the reward to be granted immediately, like points),
	 * you can set the rewardClass to null and just listen for the "onUse" event to grant the player the reward.</li></ul>
