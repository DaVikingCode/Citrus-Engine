V3.2.0, Work in Progress
------------------------
- Starling updated on 2.2.0
- Feathers updated on 3.2.0
- Added Ash.
- Removed Away3D & AwayPhysics.
- Removed Signals (available via Ash).
- State class renamed in Scene class.
- CE' scaleFactor renamed in textureScaleFactor.
- Each CitrusObject doesn't require a name anymore.
- Starling instance has skipUnchangedFrames property set to true.
- Citrus Engine's Keyboard controller : key code constants have been removed to prevent some compilation issues. citrus.input.controllers.Keyboard.as has been renamed to citrus.input.controllers.KeyboardController.as to avoid import conflicts when setting up the keyboard actions and using flash.ui.Keyboard's key codes.
- ViewportMode.FILL
- Box2D, process contacts after world step (so we can manipulate bodies in the listeners/handle*Contact)
- CitrusObject names are optional and CitrusObject has a reference to the scene it was created from (_parentScene)
- CitrusObject has handleAddedToScene and handleRemovedFromScene 'listeners'
- SceneManager and default scene transitions
- Concurrent scenes can be individually paused, physics engines are linked to their parent scene too.
- includes EazeTween's source
- a single EazeTween can be paused/resumed
- fix for random color in MathUtils
- dynamic ViewportMode change
- StarlingArt: touchGroup = true by default (helps for basic touch control of CitrusObjects)
- Removed Blitting & display list support.

V3.1.12, 03 18 2016
-------------------
- Starling updated on 1.8
- Feathers updated on 2.3.0
- DragonBones updated on 4.1

V3.1.11, 07 24 2015
-------------------
- Starling updated on 1.7
- Feathers updated on 2.1.2
- Starling.handleLostContext is always set to true
- bug fix

V3.1.10, 09 15 2014
-------------------
- Starling updated on 1.5.1
- DragonBones updated on 3.0
- Nape updated on 2.0.16
- Feathers updated 1.3.1
- Set up SoundMixer.audioPlaybackMode to "ambient" (on iOS if the physical button is off, mute the sound).
- setUpStarling method has a stage3D argument, useful for shared context.
- Citrus has its own pausable starling juggler, AnimationSequences will be attached to it by default. When CE is paused, starling keeps running but anything attached to the citrus juggler will be paused as expected.
- CitrusSoundGroup : you can stop all sounds from a group with CitrusSoundGroup.stopAllSounds
- Camera : fixed intersects/containsRect when using rotation/zoom.
- All CitrusObjects with a view now have a reference to their actual art object.
- setUpStarling : you can force starling to run on a specific stage3D with the stage3D argument of setupStarling (used in a shared context scenario)

V3.1.9, 03 05 2014
------------------
- Feathers updated on 1.2.0
- DragonBones updated on 2.4.1
- CitrusEngine.handlePlayingChange can be overriden to modify the default behavior of CE (input resetting as well as audio pause/resume).
- LevelManager enables SWF caching, very useful on iOS. Set the new property enableSwfCaching to true.
- GamePadMap.devPlatform : force a platform value to use on setups (to simulate other platforms such as WIN/MAC/LNX/AND)
- Gamepad.debug is a static boolean.
- CitrusSoundEvents moved to citrus.events package and fixed.
- Introducing CitrusEngine.transformMatrix which when using StarlingCitrusEngine describes the transformation matrix necessary to go from native stage to starling stage (includes viewport translation as well as starling stage scale). Concatenated with the camera transform matrix, its possible to simply project a point from/to the game space to/from native stage.
- Input's action lists reset when playing changes.
- in a flash State , .swf views become spriteview.AnimationSequences
- ISpriteView.handleArtReady receives newly created art (*Art object) after view assigned or loaded from url, handleArtChanged similarly  after view changes during the game.
- APhysicsObject now has a public "animation" setter.
- AGameData is a flash Proxy class so properties can be created anytime without having to extend it (and a signal is still fired on data change). AgGameData init can be used to reset values.
- Actions : removed "duck" action for "down".
- MathUtils - added log of base N, line/segment intersection function
- Fixed/Optimized Box2DPhysicsObject's rotation
- Camera.setUp signature changed + offset became center (see wiki)
- many fixes.

- DragonBones updated to 2.4
- Nape updated on 2.0.12
- Removed Spine runtime support. Use it via DragonBones library (easier to maintain only one skeleton lib).
- Updated to latest DynamicTextureAtlas extension.
- StarlingCitrusEngine offers to manage multi-resolutions (http://wiki.starling-framework.org/citrus/multi_resolution)
- ISpriteView handleArtReady/handleArtChanged - custom citrus sprite or physics objects can now react when 'the view is set (or loaded if the view was a url) or changes' to add/remove event listeners, transform the art or manipulate its content...
- Input system : justDid,isDoing,hasDone return the corresponding InputAction object or null (instead of just true or false) // actions carry messages // introduced new utility functions such as getAction() with phase/controller/channel filtering.
- Changed the way we handle the physics engine's debug drawers (due to state transition bugs, and the new nape ShapeDebug) see APhysicsEngine.debugView
- Input : removed backwards compatibility, InputActions store the time (in frames) they spent in the Input system
- MathVector : critical bug fixes (rotate, angle) and new methods (dot product, normalize, copyFrom, setTo)
- Camera : AABB rectangle is accessible using camera.getRect()
- Camera : update call can be disabled (permanently or temporarily) using camera.enabled = false - for better peformance
- Camera : added contains(x,y) , containsRect and intersectsRect as a way to know if points/objects are on or off screen and how - for objects, use their visual bounds in state space.
- Camera : added switchToTarget() to tween camera movement and switch the camera's target value
- Camera : use center instead of offset. center defines a multiple of the screen position (1,1) meaning bottom right, to decide on the camera's center position (or formerly named offset) 0.5,0.5 being the center
- SoundManager : removeAllSounds accepts exceptions, fixed stack underflow error
- SoundManager : UI sound group added by default.
- pause/resume sounds depending Event.ACTIVATE & Event.DEACTIVATE
- AnimationSequence : removeAllAnimations method

- nape Platform oneWay fixed.
- box2D Reward fixed (updates by default).
- Added a LoaderContext for SpriteArt and StarlingArt, we are able to load swf on iOS.
- Added rotation parameter in TmxObject coming from latest Tiled Map Editor builds.
